// Trees are hierarchal data structures with a single root node and several child nodes
// Binary trees have at most two child nodes per parent
// Each object in the tree holds it's own value (such as integer or string) as well as an array of it's children
// Common terminology when working with trees:
// 1. A root object is where your tree begins
// 2. A branch object is one part of your tree that has ore branches coming off of it
// 3. A leaf object is one part of your tree that has no branches coming off of it

// A root, branch and a leaf together are generally called "nodes" because they are all ultimately the same thing; a single value, plus an array of children.

//building a basic tree

// (1) To compare one node against another, we can tell Swift that Node conforms to the Equatable protocol as long as the value type itâ€™s storing also conforms to Equatable, and Thanks to conditional conformance, Swift will take care of the rest of the functionality for us, so we just write an empty extension.

// to make our tree more useful we need to add three things to it:

//1. The ability to compare nodes in the tree against each other, so we can tell if two nodes have the same value and children.
// 2. The ability to know the size of the tree, telling us how many items in total there are.
// 3.The ability to find a specific node in the tree, if it exists.

// Binary trees are suitable for various applications, including representing hierarchical data, searching, and sorting algorithms (e.g., binary search tree).
